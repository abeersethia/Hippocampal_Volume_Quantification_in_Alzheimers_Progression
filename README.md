# Hippocampal Volume Quantification in Alzheimer's Progression

An end-to-end AI system for automated hippocampal volume measurement from MRI scans to aid in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and progression tracking.

## üß† Overview

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in impaired neuronal function and eventually, cell death. AD is the most common cause of dementia, characterized by memory loss, inability to learn new material, loss of language function, and other manifestations.

For patients exhibiting early symptoms, quantifying disease progression over time can help direct therapy and disease management. A radiological study via MRI exam is currently one of the most advanced methods to quantify the disease. In particular, the measurement of hippocampal volume has proven useful to diagnose and track progression in several brain disorders, most notably in AD.

### The Hippocampus

The hippocampus is a critical structure of the human brain that plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory. Humans have two hippocampi, one in each hemisphere of the brain, located in the medial temporal lobe.

According to [studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158219302542), the volume of the hippocampus varies in a population, depending on various parameters, within certain boundaries, and it is possible to identify a "normal" range when taking into account age, sex and brain hemisphere.

### The Challenge

Measuring hippocampal volume using MRI scans is tedious since every slice of the 3D volume needs to be analyzed, and the shape of the structure needs to be traced. The hippocampus has a non-uniform shape, making manual segmentation challenging and time-consuming.
